# Interactive Mood Journal with Weather Integration

This project is a personal mood journal web application that integrates real-time weather data. It is developed as part of the **APIWIZ - Frontend Intern/Fresher Role Assignment**. The application focuses on building responsive, user-focused interfaces while utilizing public APIs and geolocation features.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to create a responsive, interactive web app that allows users to log their mood each day and visualize it alongside real-time weather data.

## Features

1. **User Interface**:
   - Clean and responsive layout compatible with mobile and desktop screens.
   - Daily mood selection system with at least 5 different mood options (represented by emojis or custom icons).
   - Short text input field for daily notes.
   - Prominent display of the current date.
   - Real-time weather display for the user's location.
   - Calendar view for past mood entries.

2. **Core Features**:
   - Mood selection with visual feedback.
   - Auto-population of the current date.
   - Geolocation API integration to fetch the userâ€™s current location.
   - Weather data fetched using a free API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
   - Mood entries linked with weather data and stored together.

3. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Custom or emoji mood icons.
   - Visual representation of weather (e.g., sun icon for clear, cloud for overcast).

4. **User Experience Features**:
   - Form validation for mood selection and note input.
   - Confirmation prompt/notification after saving an entry.
   - Calendar view showing all previous entries with mood and weather snapshots.

5. **Technical Features**:
   - Built using React and TypeScript with Vite.
   - Clean and modular code structure.
   - Local storage for storing entries.
   - Integration with a free weather API using asynchronous calls (axios).
